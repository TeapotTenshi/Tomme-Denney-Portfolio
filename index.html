        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m an XR developer with a background in Game Design and a passion for crafting immersive, meaningful experiences across virtual and mixed reality. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Extended Reality (XR) with a concentration in A.I. at Northeastern University, where I'm focused on blending spatial computing with emerging technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work spans across VR, AR, and MR — from controller-free hand interaction on Meta Quest 3 to AI-driven locomotion research in VR environments. Whether prototyping narrative-driven experiences or optimizing performance for low-spec hardware, I approach every challenge with a balance of creativity and technical precision.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve contributed to XR projects in academic, professional, and hackathon settings, with a strong emphasis on accessibility, interaction design, and player immersion. Certified through XR Terra and trained in ethical research practices, I’m deeply interested in how immersive media can shape human experience, storytelling, and education.
